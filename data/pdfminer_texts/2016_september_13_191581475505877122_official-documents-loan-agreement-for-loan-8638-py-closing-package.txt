To the extent that any  proceeds  of the Loan have  been withdrawn  as  of the

Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined by the  Bank by  multiplying the amount

-17-

of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for  said Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary, to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this Schedule,  to which a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

Amounts  of the  Loan withdrawn  within two  calendar months prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and  shall be  repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

3. 

(a) 

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the  Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption of such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that is
repayable on any Principal Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the  Conversion by either:  (i) the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange rate  component of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in  more than one  Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply separately  to  the  amount  denominated
in each  Loan  Currency, so  as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
