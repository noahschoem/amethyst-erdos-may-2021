3. 

In connection  with the forgoing:

(a)

IV.B.2  above,  as  applicable,  that:

(i) 

(ii) 

the DLIs  have  only been  partially  met, the  withdrawn  amount  of

the  respective  degree  of DLI achievement,  by  an  amount  and  in
accordance  with  a  formula  set  forth  in  the  Project  Operations
Manual  and any  Loan  balance  allocated  to  said  DLI  shall  remain

specified  in  the  Additional  Instructions  and Project  Operations  Manual.

4. 

(a) 

If the  Bank  determines  at  any time that  any amount  of the  Loan  was  used
to pay for an expenditure  which is  not an  Eligible Expenditure,  or was  not
justified  by  the  evidence  furnished  to  the  Bank,  the  Borrower  shall,
promptly  upon notice  from the  Bank,  provide  such  additional  evidence  as
the  Bank  may  request,  or  refund  to  the  Bank  an  amount  equal  to  the

SCHEDULE  3

Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first  Principal  Payment Date, the  principal amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each  Principal  Payment  Date shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by  (b) the  Installment  Share  for each  Principal  Payment  Date, such
repayable  amount to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to deduct  any  amounts  referred to
in  paragraph  4  of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency Conversion  applies.

2. 

If the  proceeds of the  Loan have  not been  fully  withdrawn as  of the  first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date shall be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the extent that  any proceeds of the Loan  have been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of  each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment  Date ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

-19-

3. 

(a) 

Amounts of the Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar  months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the date of withdrawal  and shall  be repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts  a due date billing system under which invoices
are  issued on or after the respective  Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such  sub-paragraph  shall no  longer apply  to any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption of such  billing  system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment  Date occurring during  the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior  to the Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
the  Bank  so  determines 
exchange  rate component  of the  Screen Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in more  than one Loan  Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the  amount  denominated
in  each Loan  Currency,  so  as to produce a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
