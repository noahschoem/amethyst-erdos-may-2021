payments  made  prior  to  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  except  that
withdrawals  up  to  an  aggregate  amount  not  to  exceed  five  million  one
hundred  thousand  Euros  (E5,100,000)  may  be  made  for  payments  made
prior  to  such  date  but  on  or  after  January  15,  2016,  for  Eligible
Expenditures  Programs  under  Category  (1),  provided  that  the  Borrower
has  furnished  evidence  satisfactory to  the  Bank  that  DLI  1.1  in  Table  IA
in  Annex  2 to  Schedule 2 to  this Agreement  has  been  met.

(b) 

payments  under  Category  (1)  with  respect  to  each  DLI  in  Table  1.A  of
Annex  2  to  Schedule  2  to  this  Agreement,  unless  the  Borrower  has

- 16-

as  defined  in  the  Federation  POM;  and  (ii)  payment  for  Eligible

disburse an  amount equal to  100% of the evidenced  Eligible Expenditures.
When  said Category specifies  a  Bank 50%  financing  percentage,  the Bank
shall  disburse  an  amount  equal 
to  half  of  the  evidenced  Eligible
Expenditures.

Notwithstanding  the  provision  set  forth  in  paragraph  I of  Section  IV.B  of this
Schedule,  withdrawals  by  the  Borrower  under  Category  I shall  not  exceed  the
relevant  amount  specified  in  the  "DLI  Amount"  row  of Table  I.A  in Annex  2  to
Schedule  2  to  this  Agreement,  subject  to  submission  to  the  Bank  of satisfactory

above,  that the DLI targets as  set out  in Table  LA  of Annex  2 to Schedule  2 to this
Agreement,  are  not met or are partially  met. In  this regard, with  respect to:  (a)  DLIs
1.2-1.9  if the targets  for the said DLIs  have  only  been partially met, the amount  of
the  Loan  to  be  withdrawn  shall  be:  (i) reduced  in  proportion  to  the  respective
degree  of  DLI  achievement;  and  (ii)  shall  remain  available  for  subsequent
withdrawal  until  the respective  DLI  is  met  in a  manner satisfactory to the Bank,  or
may be  cancelled  by  the  Bank;  and (b) with  respect  to  DLIs  2.1-2.4.  if the targets
for  the  said  DLIs  have  not  been  met,  the  amount  shall  remain  available  for
subsequent  withdrawal  until  the  respective  DLI  is  met  in a  manner  satisfactory  to
the  Bank, or may be cancelled by  the Bank.

With  respect to DLIs  3.1-3.5  and 4.1-4.3  in Table  LA  of Annex 2  to Schedule  2  to
this  Agreement,  if the  targets  for  said  DLIs  are  not  met, the  DLI  Amounts  shall
remain  available  for  subsequent  withdrawals  until  the  respective  DLI  is  met  in a
manner satisfactory  to the Bank, or may be  cancelled  by the Bank.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  at  any  time, by  notice  to  the Borrower,  the  Bank
may cancel  the amount of the  Loan  proceeds  so withheld  or reallocate  said amount
to other DLIs.

If the Bank  determines,  at any  time,  that any  portion of the amounts  disbursed  by
the  Borrower  under  Category  I was  made  for  reimbursement  of expenditures  that
are  not  eligible  under  the  EEPs,  the  Borrower  shall  promptly  refund  any  such
amount to  the Bank as  the Bank  shall  specify by  notice to the  Borrower.

SCHEDULE  3

Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the  proceeds  of the Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn  as  of the first Principal  Payment Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each  Principal  Payment  Date shall  be  determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment  Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share for each  Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount  to  be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to which a  Currency  Conversion applies.

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan  have not  been fully  withdrawn  as  of the first Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment Date  shall  be  determined  as follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the extent that  any proceeds  of the  Loan have  been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable to be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency
Conversion  applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan withdrawn  within  two  calendar months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as

- 27  -

withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal  and shall  be  repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time  the Bank adopts a  due date billing  system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall  no longer apply to  any withdrawals  made  after
the adoption  of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1 and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or  any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the  Conversion by either:  (i) the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component  of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the amount  denominated
in each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
