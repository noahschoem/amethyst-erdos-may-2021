Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that is  repayable  on  any
Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the Conversion  Period,  shall be determined  by
the Bank by  multiplying  such  amount  in its  currency  of denomination  immediately  prior
to the  Conversion by  either:  (i) the exchange rate that  reflects  the amounts  of principal  in
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the
Conversion  Guidelines,  the exchange rate component of the  Screen Rate.

5. 

If the.Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each
Loan Currency,  so as to  produce  a separate  amortization  schedule for each such  amount.
