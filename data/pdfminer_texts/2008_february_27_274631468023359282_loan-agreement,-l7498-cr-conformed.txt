Special Procurement Provisions

Procurement  of  Goods  and  Works Without  limitation  upon  other  provisions  of  this 
Section or the Procurement Guidelines, the following additional provisions shall apply to 
all  goods,  non-consultants  services  and  works  procured  for  the  Project  under  contracts 
awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (“NCB Contracts”): 

1. 

 

The  Borrower  shall  submit  (or  cause  to  be  submitted)  all  forms  and  models  of 
requests for quotations and bidding documents that the Borrower proposes to use 
for  the  procurement  of  goods  and  works  under  NCB  Contracts  (the  “Standard 
Bidding Documents”) to the Bank for its approval before the Borrower issues its 
first invitation for bids for any of the NCB Contracts for the Project.  Except as 
the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  the  Borrower  shall  not  amend,  revise  or 
otherwise  modify  or  change  the  Standard  Bidding  Documents  that  have  been 
approved by the Bank in accordance with the foregoing sentence (the “Approved 
Bidding Documents”). 

Each  bid  shall  be  evaluated  and  the  corresponding  contract  awarded  to  the 
responsive  bidder:  (a)  who  meets  the  appropriate  technical  and  financial 
standards or capabilities; and (b) whose bid has been determined to be the lowest 
evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the 
specifications,  conditions  and  evaluation  criteria  stipulated  in  the  Approved 
Bidding Documents.  If the bid evaluation will consider any factor other than the 
amount or amounts of each bid, the Approved Bidding Documents will precisely 
stipulate and describe each such factor, including, inter alia, the manner in which 
such  factor  will  be  quantified  and  given  a  relative  weight  for  purposes  of 
determining the lowest evaluated bid.  The award of goods and works contracts 
shall  be  based  exclusively  on  price  and,  whenever  appropriate,  shall  also  take 
into  account  factors  similar  to  those  referred  to  in  paragraph  2.52  of  the 
Procurement Guidelines; provided, however, that the bid evaluation shall always 
be based on factors that can be quantified objectively, and the procedure for such 
quantification  shall  be  disclosed  in  the  invitation  to  bid.  For  purposes  of  bid 
evaluation and comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor 
shall be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in the corresponding bid, as such 
bid may be corrected by the Borrower for arithmetic errors. 

(a) 

 
(b) 

 

-16- 

Foreign bidders shall be allowed to participate and shall not, as a condition for 
participating in the bidding process, be required to: 

be registered in the Borrower’s territory; 

have a representative in the Borrower’s territory; 

enter into a joint venture agreement with local bidders; or 

legalize  their  bids  or  any  documentation  related  to  such  bids  with  an 
embassy  or  consulate  of  the  Borrower,  the  Borrower’s  Ministry  of 
Foreign Affairs, or any other governmental authority or representative of 
the Borrower, as a pre-condition to participating in the bidding process. 

 
No  reference  value  shall  be  required  for  publication  in  the  bidding  documents 
and call for bids. 

Any  standards  and  technical  specifications  (quoted  in  the  bidding  documents) 
which  are  at  least  substantially  equivalent  to  the  standards  and  technical 
specifications of the Borrower shall be acceptable. 

No minimum number of responsive proposals shall be required prior to awarding 
a contract for goods or works. 

No margin of preference shall be granted for any particular category of bidders. 

The Borrower shall open, or cause the opening of, all bids at the stipulated time 
and place in accordance with a procedure satisfactory to the Bank.  

No  other  procurement  rules  or  regulations  of  the  Borrower  shall  apply  without 
the prior review and approval of the Bank.

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of  the  Loan  and  the 
percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal Payment 
Date (“Installment Share”).  If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully withdrawn as of 
the  first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the 
Borrower  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by 
multiplying:  (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the first Principal Payment Date; by (b) 
the  Installment  Share  for  each  Principal  Payment  Date[,  such  repayable  amount  to  be 
adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, 
to which a Currency Conversion applies.

2.  

If  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  have  not  been  fully  withdrawn  as  of  the  first  Principal 
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each 
Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows: 

(a) 

 
(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the first 
Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the Withdrawn Loan Balance 
as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule. 

Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be repaid on 
each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such withdrawal in amounts 
determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount of each such withdrawal by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the original Installment Share specified in the 
table in paragraph 1 of this Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original 
Installment  Share”)  and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining 
Original Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such 
date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any amounts 
referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency  Conversion 
applies. 

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar  months  prior  to  any 
Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the principal 
amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as  withdrawn  and 

-22- 

outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date  following  the  date  of 
withdrawal and shall be repayable on each Principal Payment Date commencing 
with the second Principal Payment Date following the date of withdrawal. 

(b) 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if at any 
time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices are issued 
on  or  after  the  respective  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  provisions  of  such  sub-
paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any  withdrawals  made  after  the  adoption  of 
such billing system.  

 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a Currency 
Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an  Approved 
Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any 
Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period, shall be determined by 
the Bank by multiplying such amount in its currency of denomination immediately prior 
to the Conversion by either: (i) the exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in 
the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the  Bank  under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction 
relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the 
Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.  

If  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the 
provisions  of  this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the  amount  denominated  in  each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
