million Dollars ($300,000,000). 

Section 2.02. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this 
Section,  the  Borrower  shall  be  entitled  to  withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  from  the

- 3 -

(b)  

The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank the first request 
for  withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account,  and  thereafter  maintain  in  its  central  bank,  a 
deposit  account  in  Dollars  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  the  Bank.  All 
withdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  shall  be  deposited  by  the  Bank  into  the  Deposit

(c) 

The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 
to  finance  expenditures  excluded  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Schedule  1  to  this 
Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall  have  been  used  to  make  a  payment  for  an  expenditure so  excluded, the  Borrower 
shall,  promptly  upon  notice  from  the  Bank,  (i)  deposit  into  the  Deposit  Account  an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment, or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, refund

credited to the Loan Account for cancellation.

No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account: (i) until the fee

the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  withdrawn  from  the  Loan  Account  shall  have  reached  the 
amount  of  one  hundred  fifty  million  Dollars  ($150,000,000),  unless  the  Bank  shall  be 
satisfied, after an exchange of views as described in Section 3.01 of this Agreement based 
on evidence satisfactory to the Bank: (A) with the progress achieved by the Borrower in 
the  carrying  out  of  Program;  (B)  that  the  macroeconomic  policy  framework  of  the 
Borrower  is  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  Program;  and  (C)  that  the  actions 
described  in  Schedule  3  to  this  Agreement  have  been  taken,  in  form  and  substance 
satisfactory  to  the  Bank.  If,  after  said  exchange  of  views,  the  Bank  shall  have  given 
notice to the Borrower that the progress achieved and actions taken are not satisfactory, 
or  that  the  macroeconomic  framework  is  not  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the 
Program,  and,  within  90  days  after  such  notice,  the  Borrower  shall  not  have  achieved 
progress and taken actions satisfactory to the Bank, or the macroeconomic framework has 
not become consistent with the objectives of the Program, as the case may be, then the 
Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of the Loan or any 
part thereof. 

Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be March 31, 2000, or such later date as the 

Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date. 

Section 2.04. On or promptly after the Effective Date, the Borrower shall pay to 

the Bank a fee in an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the amount of the Loan.

rate of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum on the principal amount of the 
Loan not withdrawn from time to time.  

- 4 -

Section 2.06. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of the 
Loan  withdrawn  and  outstanding  from  time  to  time,  at  a  rate  for  each  Interest  Period 
equal to LIBOR Base Rate plus LIBOR Total Spread.

determination of the interest rates referred to in this Section, the Bank determines that it

determining  the  interest  rates  applicable  to  the  Loan  other  than  as  provided  in  said 
Section, the  Bank  may  modify  the  basis  for  determining  the interest  rates  applicable  to 
the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower of the new basis. The
