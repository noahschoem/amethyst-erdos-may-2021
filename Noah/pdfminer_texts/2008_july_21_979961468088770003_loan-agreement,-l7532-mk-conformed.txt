Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such

(a) 

 

(b) 

Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any

following  the  date  of  withdrawal  and  shall  be  repayable  on  each 
Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment 
Date following the date of withdrawal. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if 
at  any  time  the  Bank  adopts  a  due  date  billing  system  under  which 
invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the 
provisions  of  such  sub-paragraph  shall  no  longer  apply  to  any 
withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

Currency  Conversion  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an 
Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is repayable 
on  any  Principal  Payment  Date  occurring  during  the  Conversion  Period,  shall  be 
determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination 
immediately  prior  to  the  Conversion  by  either:  (i)  the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the 
amounts of principal in the Approved Currency payable by the Bank under the Currency 
Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if  the  Bank  so  determines  in 
accordance with the Conversion Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen 
Rate.  
 
If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated in each 
Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for each such amount.
