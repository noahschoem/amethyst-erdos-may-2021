(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment Date,  be  treated as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal  and shall be repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions of sub-paragraph (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date,  the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer  apply to any withdrawals made  after
the  adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in the  Approved  Currency  that is
repayable  on any Principal Payment Date  occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank by multiplying  such  amount  in its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the  Conversion by either  (i) the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate  component of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more than one  Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this Schedule  shall  apply  separately to  the amount  denominated
in  each Loan Currency,  so as  to produce  a separate  amortization schedule  for each
such amount.
