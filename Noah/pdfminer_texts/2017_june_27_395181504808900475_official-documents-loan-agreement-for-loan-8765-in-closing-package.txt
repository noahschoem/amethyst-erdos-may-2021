The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment  Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  been fully
withdrawn as  of the first Principal Payment  Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower  on each Principal Payment Date shall be determined by
the Bank  by multiplying:  (a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date; by (b)  the Installment Share  for each Principal  Payment Date, such
repayable  amount to be adjusted,  as necessary, to  deduct  any  amounts referred  to
in paragraph  4 of this  Schedule, to which a Currency Conversion applies.

If the proceeds  of the  Loan have  not been fully  withdrawn as of the  first Principal

each Principal Payment Date shall  be determined as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the  extent that any proceeds  of the Loan have been withdrawn as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal in  amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for  said Principal Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to be  adjusted,  as necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred to in  paragraph  4  of this Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion applies.

- 15  -

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the  Loan  withdrawn  within  two calendar months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of  calculating  the
principal  amounts payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following the  date of withdrawal  and shall  be  repayable  on each  Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this paragraph,  if
at any  time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective  Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the  adoption of such billing system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to  the Conversion  by either:  (i)  the exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under the  Currency Hedge  Transaction relating  to the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.
