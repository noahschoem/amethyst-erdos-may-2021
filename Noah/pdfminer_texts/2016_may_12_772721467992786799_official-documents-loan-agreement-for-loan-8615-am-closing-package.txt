SCHEDULE  3

Amortization  Schedule

The following table  sets  forth the Principal  Payment Dates of the Loan  and the percentage
of  the  total  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date
("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the Loan have been fully  withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the Loan  repayable  by  the Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  determined  by 
the  Bank  by  multiplying:
(a) Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the first Principal  Payment Date;  by (b)  the  Installment
Share for each Principal  Payment Date, such repayable amount  to be adjusted,  as necessary,
to  deduct  any  amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4  of  this  Schedule,  to  which  a  Currency
Conversion  applies.

If the proceeds  of the Loan have  not been  fully  withdrawn  as  of the first Principal  Payment
Date,  the  principal  amount  of  the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  shall be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To  the extent  that any  proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  withdrawn  as  of the first
Principal  Payment Date,  the  Borrower shall  repay the Withdrawn  Loan Balance  as
of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I of this  Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be  repaid  on
each  Principal  Payment Date  falling  after  the date  of such  withdrawal  in  amounts
determined  by  the Bank  by  multiplying  the amount  of each  such  withdrawal  by  a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the
table  in  paragraph  I  of this  Schedule  for  said  Principal  Payment Date  ("Original
