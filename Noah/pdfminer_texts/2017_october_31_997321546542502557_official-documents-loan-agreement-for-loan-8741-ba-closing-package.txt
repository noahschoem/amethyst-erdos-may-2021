(1) 

Registration

bidding shall  not  be restricted to  pre-registered  firms;

where  registration  is  required,  bidders:  (i)  shall  be  allowed  a  reasonable
time  to  complete  the  registration  process;  and  (ii)  shall  not  be  denied
registration  for  reasons  unrelated  to  their  capability  and  resources  to
successfully  perform  the  contract,  which  shall  be  verified  through  post-
qualification;  and

foreign  bidders  shall  not  be  precluded  from  bidding.  If  a  registration
process  is required,  a  foreign  bidder  declared  the  lowest evaluated  bidder
shall  be given  a  reasonable opportunity  to  register.

(2) 

Advertising

(3) 

Pre-qualification

Invitations to bid  shall be  advertised  in at least one widely  circulated  national  daily
newspaper  allowing  a  minimum  of  thirty  (30)  days  for  the  preparation  and
submission  of bids.

When pre-qualification  shall  be required for large  or complex contracts,  invitations
to  pre-qualify  for  bidding  shall  be  advertised  in  at  least  one  widely  circulated
national  daily  newspaper  a  minimum  of thirty (30)  days  prior to the  deadline  for
the  submission  of  pre-qualification  applications.  Minimum  experience  and
technical  and  financial  requirements  shall  be  explicitly  stated 
in  the  pre-
qualification  documents.

(4) 

Participation by  State-owned  enterprises

State-owned  enterprises  in  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  including those  in  the  FBiH
and  RS,  shall  be  eligible  to  participate  in  bidding  only  if they  can  establish  that
they  are  legally  and  financially  autonomous,  operate  under  commercial  law  and
are  not  a dependent  agency  of the  contracting  authority.  Furthermore,  they will  be
subject  to the same bid  and performance  security requirements  as  other  bidders.

-16-

(5) 

Bidding Documents

Procuring  entities  shall  use  the  appropriate  standard  bidding  documents  for  the
procurement  of goods or services,  acceptable  to the Bank.

(6)

(c) 

bids  shall  be  opened 
submission  of bids;

in  public, 

immediately  after  the  deadline  for

evaluation  of  bids  shall  be  made  in  strict  adherence  to  the  monetarily
quantifiable  criteria declared  in the  bidding  documents;  and

lowest-evaluated,  substantially  responsive  bid  and  no  negotiation  shall
take  place.

(7)

(9) 

Securities

concurrence.

bid  security  and  performance  security  should  follow  the  generally  accepted
practice  used in  the local  market;

alternative  methods  such  as  bid  securing  declaration  may  be  acceptable,  in
which  case  the Borrower  may require  bidders to sign  a  declaration  accepting
that if they withdraw  or modify  their bids  during the period of validity or they
are  awarded  the  contract  and  they  fail  to  sign  the  contract  or  to  submit  a
performance  security  before  the  deadline  defined  in  the bidding  documents,
the  bidder  will  be  suspended 
for  bidding  in  any  contract  with  the
implementing  unit; and

(c) 

no advance  payment  shall  be  made  to contractors  without  a suitable  advance
payment security.  These securities  shall  be included in  the bidding documents
in  a text and  format acceptable  to the Bank.

inspect their accounts  and  records relating  to the procurement  and performance  of
the  contract  and to  have  said  accounts  and  records  audited  by  auditors  appointed
by  the  Bank.  The  deliberate  and  material  violation  by  the  supplier,  contractor  or
subcontractor  of such provision  may  amount to  obstructive practice.

(11) 

Fraud and Corruption

The  Bank shall  declare  a  firm  or individual  ineligible,  either  indefinitely or  for a
stated  period,  to be awarded  a  contract financed  by the  Bank,  if it  at any time
determines  that the firm  or individual  has, directly  or through  an agent, engaged
in  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  coercive  or  obstructive  practices  in  competing
for,  or in executing,  a  contract financed  by the  World  Bank Group.

SCHEDULE  3

Amortization  Schedule

The  following  table  sets  forth  the  Principal  Payment  Dates  of the  Loan  and  the
percentage  of the  total  principal  amount  of the  Loan  payable  on  each  Principal
Payment Date  ("Installment  Share").  If the proceeds  of the  Loan  have  been  fully
withdrawn  as of the first Principal  Payment  Date, the principal  amount of the Loan
repayable  by the Borrower on each  Principal  Payment Date  shall be determined  by
the  Bank  by  multiplying: 
(a)  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  as  of the  first  Principal
Payment Date;  by (b)  the Installment  Share  for each  Principal  Payment  Date,  such
repayable  amount  to be adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any amounts  referred  to
in paragraph 4 of this  Schedule,  to  which  a Currency  Conversion applies.

Principal Payment  Date

2. 

If the proceeds  of the Loan  have not  been fully  withdrawn  as  of the first  Principal
Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on
each  Principal  Payment Date  shall  be  determined  as  follows:

(a) 

(b) 

To the extent that any proceeds  of the Loan  have been withdrawn as  of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of  this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts  determined  by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in  paragraph  4 of this  Schedule,  to which  a Currency
Conversion applies.

3. 

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within  two  calendar months  prior to  any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the

-19-

principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal  and shall  be  repayable on  each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date  of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a)  of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank adopts  a due date billing system under which invoices
are  issued on or after the respective Principal  Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption  of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all or  any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment  Date occurring  during the Conversion  Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately  prior to the Conversion  by either:  (i)  the exchange  rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank  under  the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to the  Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines 
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the  Screen  Rate.

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan Currency,
the provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to  the amount  denominated
in  each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
