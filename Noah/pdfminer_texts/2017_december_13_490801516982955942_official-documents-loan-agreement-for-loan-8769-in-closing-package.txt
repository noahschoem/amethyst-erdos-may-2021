Payment Date; by (b)  the Installment  Share  for each  Principal Payment Date,  such

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months  prior to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on any  Principal  Payment  Date.  be  treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the date of withdrawal  and shall be repayable on  each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank  adopts a due date  billing system under which  invoices

of such sub-paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after
the  adoption of such billing system.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  I  and  2  of this  Schedule,  upon a
Currency  Conversion  of all or any  portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment Date occurring  during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such amount  in  its  currency  of
denomination  immediately prior to the  Conversion by  either.  (i) the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in the  Approved  Currency  payable  by the
Bank  under the Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
the  Bank  so  determines 
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

If the Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is denominated  in more than one  Loan Currency,
the  provisions of this  Schedule shall  apply  separately  to the  amount denominated
in each  Loan Currency,  so as to produce  a separate amortization  schedule for each
such  amount.
