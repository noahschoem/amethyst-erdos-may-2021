Principal  Payment  Date,  the  principal  amount  of the  Loan  repayable  by  the  Borrower  on

Installment  Share")  and  the  denominator  of which  is  the  sum  of all  remaining

(a) 

Amounts  of the Loan withdrawn  within two calendar months prior to any Principal
Payment  Date  shall,  for the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the  principal  amounts
payable  on  any  Principal  Payment Date,  be treated  as  withdrawn  and  outstanding

14

(b) 

be  repayable  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second
Principal  Payment Date following  the  date of withdrawal.

time the  Bank adopts  a due  date billing system under which  invoices are  issued on

paragraph  shall no longer apply to any withdrawals made after the adoption of such
billing system.

Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn  Loan Balance to  an Approved Currency,
the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is  repayable  on  any  Principal
Payment Date  occurring during the Conversion  Period, shall be determined  by the Bank by
multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of  denomination  immediately  prior  to  the
Conversion  by  either:  (i) the  exchange  rate  that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the
Approved  Currency  payable by  the  Bank under  the Currency  Hedge Transaction  relating
to  the  Conversion;  or  (ii)  if the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion
Guidelines,  the exchange  rate  component  of the  Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  is  denominated  in  more  than  one  Loan  Currency,  the
provisions of this Schedule  shall apply separately to the  amount denominated in each  Loan
Currency, so  as to produce  a separate  amortization  schedule  for each  such  amount.
