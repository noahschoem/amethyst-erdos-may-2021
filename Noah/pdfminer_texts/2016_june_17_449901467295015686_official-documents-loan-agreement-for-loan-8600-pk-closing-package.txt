3. 

(a) 

To  the extent that  any proceeds  of the Loan have  been withdrawn  as of the
first  Principal  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall  repay  the  Withdrawn
Loan  Balance  as  of such  date  in  accordance  with  paragraph  I  of this
Schedule.

Any  amount  withdrawn  after  the  first  Principal  Payment  Date  shall  be
repaid  on  each  Principal  Payment  Date  falling  after  the  date  of  such
withdrawal  in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the amount
of each  such  withdrawal  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  is  the
original  Installment  Share  specified  in  the  table  in  paragraph  1  of  this
Schedule  for said  Principal  Payment  Date  ("Original  Installment  Share")
and  the  denominator  of  which  is  the  sum  of  all  remaining  Original
Installment  Shares  for  Principal  Payment  Dates  falling  on  or  after  such
date,  such  amounts  repayable  to  be  adjusted,  as  necessary,  to  deduct  any
amounts  referred  to  in paragraph  4  of this Schedule,  to which a Currency
Conversion  applies.

Amounts  of the Loan  withdrawn  within two  calendar months prior  to any
Principal  Payment  Date  shall,  for  the  purposes  solely  of calculating  the
principal  amounts  payable  on  any  Principal  Payment  Date,  be treated  as
withdrawn  and  outstanding  on  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date of withdrawal  and shall be  repayable  on each Principal
Payment  Date  commencing  with  the  second  Principal  Payment  Date
following  the  date of withdrawal.

(b) 

Notwithstanding  the provisions  of sub-paragraph  (a) of this  paragraph,  if
at any time the Bank  adopts a due date billing system under which invoices
are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the provisions
of such sub-paragraph shall  no longer apply to any withdrawals  made after
the adoption  of such billing  system.

4. 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of paragraphs  1  and  2  of  this  Schedule,  upon  a
Currency  Conversion  of all  or any portion  of the  Withdrawn  Loan  Balance  to  an
Approved  Currency,  the  amount  so  converted  in  the  Approved  Currency  that  is
repayable  on any Principal  Payment  Date occurring during the Conversion Period,
shall  be  determined  by  the  Bank  by  multiplying  such  amount  in  its  currency  of

-22-

denomination  immediately prior to the  Conversion by either:  (i) the  exchange rate
that  reflects  the  amounts  of principal  in  the  Approved  Currency  payable  by  the
Bank under  the  Currency  Hedge  Transaction  relating  to  the Conversion;  or (ii)  if
the  Bank  so  determines  in  accordance  with  the  Conversion  Guidelines,  the
exchange  rate component  of the Screen  Rate.

5. 

If the  Withdrawn  Loan Balance  is denominated  in more  than one  Loan  Currency,
the  provisions  of this  Schedule  shall  apply  separately  to the amount  denominated
in each Loan Currency,  so as to  produce  a  separate amortization  schedule  for each
such  amount.
